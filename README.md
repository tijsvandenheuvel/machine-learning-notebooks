# machine learning notebooks

## connect-4 Reinforcement learning

This project was a personal introduction to Reinforcement learning.

It uses the environment from the connect-x [kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx)

I haven't gone much further than trying to get it to work 

based on notebooks published by others in the kaggle challenge.

>This is a web graph of Wikipedia hyperlinks collected in September 2011. The network was constructed by first taking the largest strongly connected component of Wikipedia, then restricting to pages in the top set of categories (those with at least 100 pages), and finally taking the largest strongly connected component of the restricted graph.
