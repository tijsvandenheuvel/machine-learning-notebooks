# machine learning notebooks

## connect-4 Reinforcement learning

This project was a personal introduction to Reinforcement learning.

It uses the environment from the connect-x [kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx)

I haven't gone much further than trying to get it to work 

based on notebooks published by others in the kaggle challenge.

## Predict Absenteeism

This project was the final assignment for the course _AI principles_ 

by _David D'Haese_ 

from the _AP University College Antwerp_

The goal of this data analysis report is to predict if an employee will be absent often based on variables of the Absenteeism At Work dataset, with a focus on feature contribution.
